# TNoodleServer #

An http server built to generate scrambles and images for twisty puzzles. Supports json, png, svg, pdf, and zip formats.  It is currently being used by the following programs.

* [TNT](/tnt/) - A new timer aiming to replace CCT.
* [WCA Scramble Program](/scramble) - WCA scramble program. See [its readme](/readme/scramble).
* [bld.js](/tnt/bld.html) - A bld cycle generator for Pochmann-style combine orient+permute methods.

Looking for something that's missing? Want to contribute? Check out the latest version of the code on [github](http://github.com/thewca/tnoodle)!

## API ##

Note: All pages that serve up json also support jsonp via a callback parameter. For simplicity of the documentation, that optional callback parameter has been omitted.

### puzzles/[PUZZLE_NAME].json?[includeStatus] ###

If `PUZZLE_NAME` is not specified, returns a list of `PUZZLE_STATUS`'s in json format.

A `PUZZLE_STATUS` looks like this:

        {
                longName: LONG_NAME,
                shortName: SHORT_NAME,
                initializationStatus: INITIALIZATION_STATUS
        }

`INITIALIZATION_STATUS` is a double between 0 and 1 inclusive, and should increase monotonically to 1. Most programs can happily ignore this, but some scramblers take a very long time to initialize (4x4x4 can take several minutes), so this allows programs to let the user know that things are actually happening. `initializationStatus` is only included if the includeStatus parameter is specified.

If `PUZZLE_NAME` is specified, returns just the `PUZZLE_STATUS` for the specified puzzle.

### scramble/[TITLE].[txt|json|pdf|zip]?[PARAMS] ###

`PARAMS` include "seed", "showIndices" and most importantly, an arbitrary number of `PUZZLE_REQUEST`'s. Note that this means you can't have a round titled "seed" or "showIndices"!

`PUZZLE_REQUEST`'s look like this:

        TITLE=PUZZLE*COUNT*COPIES*SCHEME

PUZZLE can be any scrambler from [puzzles/](/puzzles/).

COUNT can be an integer, or "fmc". "fmc" means generate one scramble, and is specially handled by the PDF generator. See [scramble/Big Competition.pdf?FMC Round 1=333*fmc](/scramble/Big Competition.pdf?FMC Round 1=333*fmc) for an example.

If SCHEME contains a comma, then it is assumed to be a comma separated list of COLORs. If it does not contain a comma, then each character is treated as a COLOR. COLORs must be specified in alphabetical order of the names of the puzzle's faces. To see the faces for a puzzle, visit [view/PUZZLE.json](/view/PUZZLE.json)

A `COLOR` either an HTML style hexadecimal color definition starting with #, such as #FFFFFF for white. If `COLOR` does not begin with #, then is must be one of the following color definitions:

* y, yellow
* b, blue
* r, red
* g, green
* o, orange
* p, purple
* 0, gray, grey

If `SCHEME` does not conform to the above definition, then the puzzle's default color scheme will be used.

Puzzle request titles must be unique.

* [scramble/.txt?=333](/scramble/.txt?=333) - A text file containing 1 3x3 scramble. Revisiting this url will generate different scrambles.
* [scramble/.txt?=333*12&seed=cubing](/scramble/.txt?=333*12&seed=cubing) - A text file with 12 3x3 scrambles generated from the seed "cubing". Revisiting this url will always generate the same 12 scrambles.
* [scramble/My Comp.pdf?3x3 Round 1=333*5](/scramble/My Comp.pdf?3x3 Round 1=333*5) - A single 3x3 sheet of 5 scrambles.
* [scramble/My Comp.pdf?3x3 Round 1=333\*5\*2](/scramble/My Comp.pdf?3x3 Round 1=333*5*2) - 2 identical copies of a 3x3 sheet of 5 scrambles. This will produce a 2 page PDF.
* [scramble/My Comp.pdf?3x3 Round 1=333\*5\*2&3x3 Round 2=333\*5](/scramble/My Comp.pdf?3x3 Round 1=333*5*2&3x3 Round 2=333*5) - 2 identical copies of a 3x3 sheet of 5 scrambles (titled "3x3 Round 1")
followed by 1 page of 5 3x3 scrambles (titled "3x3 Round 2"). This will produce a 3 page PDF.
* [scramble/My Comp.zip?3x3 Round 1=333\*5\*2&3x3 Round 2=333\*5](/scramble/My Comp.zip?3x3 Round 1=333*5*2&3x3 Round 2=333*5) - This will produce a zip file containing 2 pdfs, one named "3x3 Round 1.pdf" and the other named "3x3 Round 2.pdf". Note that when the file extension is zip, we ignore the COPIES option. I think this is a good decision.
* [scramble/.json?=333](/scramble/.json?=333) - One 3x3 scramble in json.

### view/PUZZLE.[png|svg|json]?scramble=SCRAMBLE ###

If json, then boundaries of the puzzles faces will be returned in json format. This is necessary information for creating a color scheme chooser.

<a href="view/sq1.png?scramble=(3,3) /"><img src="view/sq1.png?scramble=(3,3) /" /></a>
<a href="view/sq1.svg?scramble=(3,3) /"><img src="view/sq1.svg?scramble=(3,3) /" /></a>

### POST to view/TITLE.[pdf|zip] ###

The body should be `scrambles=SCRAMBLES`, where `SCRAMBLES` is a json string that was retrieved from scramble/.json (see "A fullfilled scramble request").

### import/?url=URL ###
url is a url pointing to a text file with newline separated scrambles.
The scrambles will be returned through the callback (if specified).

This url also supports HTML form POST uploading of text files. The response is a Javascript script that calls parent.postMessage with all the scrambles as an argument.
